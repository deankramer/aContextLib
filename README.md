# aContextLib
An Android specific software library developed for developers to more easily, and quickly use Android sensors and other data sources in a unified way. This library was started for the EU Project, POSEIDON (http://www.poseidon-project.org). This library is also used in the POSEIDON-Context Context-awareness reasoner.

Now, while I am no longer a Middlesex University employee, I continue to add to this library as a hobby, and are open to new ideas to improve it.
